# MSc-Dissertation-Variational-Inference
Dissertation for the degree of MSc Statistical Science at the University of Oxford. 
Supervised by Dr. Kam√©lia Daudel and Professor Arnaud Doucet. 

The goal of this project is to explore how one can improve the standard KL variational inference methodology
by (i) selecting the alpha-divergence as a more general class of objective functions and (ii) 
enlarging the search space beyond the traditional framework used in Variational Inference.
