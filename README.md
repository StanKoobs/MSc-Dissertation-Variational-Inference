# MSc-Dissertation-Variational-Inference

The goal of this project is to explore how one can improve the standard KL variational inference methodology
by (i) selecting the alpha-divergence as a more general class of objective functions and (ii)
enlarging the search space beyond the traditional framework used in Variational Inference.
Supervised by Kamelia Daudel and Arnaud Doucet.
