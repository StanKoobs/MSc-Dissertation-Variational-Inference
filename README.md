# MSc-Dissertation-Variational-Inference
Dissertation for the degree of MSc Statistical Science at the University of Oxford. 
Supervised by Dr. Kam√©lia Daudel and Professor Arnaud Doucet. 
Title: Variational Inference with general families of divergence measures.

The goal of this project is to explore how one can improve the standard KL variational inference methodology
by (i) selecting the alpha-divergence as a more general class of objective functions and (ii) 
enlarging the search space beyond the traditional framework used in Variational Inference.
